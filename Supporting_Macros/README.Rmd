```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
pluginName = 'SimScoring.yxmc'
```

Simulation Scoring allows for sampling. The sampling can be done parametrically from a distribution, from input data, or as a combination - best fitting to a distribution and sampling from that. The data can also be "drawn", if one is unsure of the parameters of a distribution but is also lacking data.

### Inputs

There are 3 inputs.

```{r echo = F, comment = NA, results = 'asis', warning = F}
AlteryxRhelper::extractInputOutput(pluginName)
```

### Configuration Properties

```{r echo = F, comment = NA, results = 'asis', warning = F}
AlteryxRhelper::extractConfig(pluginName)
```

### Output

```{r echo = F, comment = NA, results = 'asis', warning = F}
AlteryxRhelper::extractInputOutput(pluginName, type = 'output')
```

### Error Distribution Sampling Methodology

- GLM Scoring - in the case of scoring a General Linear Model, due to properties of GLMs, the error distribution can be directly sampled from.
- Non-GLM Scoring - in the case of scoring other models, homoscedasticity of the error distributions with respect to the predictors is assumed. This allows a single error distribution to be calculated by scoring the model against a validations set. That error distribution is then sampled from and added to score results for the incoming data.
